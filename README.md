## Visualized Hotel Booking Data: Power BI Dashboard 

I’ve developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze and validate cancellation trends in hotel bookings, bridging Python-based insights with interactive visualizations. This dashboard provides a deeper understanding of factors like ADR (Average Daily Rate), lead time, and market segments that influence cancellations.

## Visualizations Highlighted:

#### Line Charts:
ADR trends over time to investigate its impact on cancellations.
Cancellation trends over time to identify recurring patterns.
#### Pie Charts:
Overall cancellation split between City and Resort Hotels.
Cancellations from the top 5 countries, revealing regional differences.
#### Column Chart:
Cancellation distribution across market segments, identifying high-risk categories.
Clustered Column Chart:
A comparative view of cancellations by lead time and meal type, showcasing how these factors interact.
Bar Chart:
Cancellations based on lead time to understand the role of early and last-minute bookings.

## Objective:
To uncover actionable insights and empower stakeholders with strategies to reduce cancellations, optimize pricing, and enhance guest experiences.
